            About Me
          </h2>
          <p>
            Hi, I'm Gedeon and I'm a twenty-one year old student and software
            developer based out in South Florida. I specialize in primarily
            frontend development for web based React applications. My tools
            usually consist of TailwindCSS for styling, NextJS for messing
            around with full stack applications and finally, Vercel to manage
            and deploy my applications. More recently, I've been dabbling with
            C++ and Zig with hopes to make some low level contributions in the
            future.
          </p>
          <p>
            Currently, I'm working on an open source project called Commet where
            I help with developing and maintaining this new Matrix client, built
            with Flutter. In the past, I've also volunteered for Wevise, a non
            profit organization for mentors and mentees. My role there was to
            help with building beautiful interfaces and components.
          </p>
          <p>
            In my free time, I often enjoy learning and building small scale
            applications with new tech and contributing to open source projects
            with the goal in mind that one day I'd be able to apply what I've
            learn with my own personal projects.
          </p>
